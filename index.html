I am fascinated about the idea of building intelligent systems that can help humans (and why not, other intelligent agents) on their daily tasks. This goal is ambitious, challenging, inspiring, and best of all, multi-disciplinary: it lies at a pivotal intersection between areas that I am really interested in, such as AI, cognitive science, psychology, biology, neurophysiology, linguistics, adaptive behavior, computer science, and software engineering.

My research interests mainly focus on topics related to Artificial Cognition &amp; Cognitive Architectures, Machine Learning, Computational Intelligence, Hybrid Systems, Evolutionary Computation, Intelligent Autonomous Agents (e.g., personal assistants, robotic systems, intelligent tutoring systems, conversational agents, multi agent systems, etc.), and Large-scale System Design. My goal is to build robust and complex software systems that integrate all of these areas in a synergistic manner in order to solve real-world problems.
